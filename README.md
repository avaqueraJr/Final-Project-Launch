# WEATHER API

The program will hitherto be referred to as "WEATHER API" until we think of a totally lit name for it.  Who was the bad guy from the G.I. Joe animated series that had a machine that could control the weather?  Or the freaky eyeball monster from Final Fantasy that looked like the Beholder from Dungeons & Dragons?
